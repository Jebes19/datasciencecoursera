This repository contains the data and code to replicate my final project. The fully run notebook is accessbile via a pdf as well, but the tools are here to run the notebook should you want to. 

For space, all the data folders were zipped, but unpacking the entire folder in the same folder as the notebook file should keep all the links working.
